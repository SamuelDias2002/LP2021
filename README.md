----------------------------Welcome----------------------------


Welcome to this little program which does some operations to an array!

To be able to run this program you should be aware if you have these files: -funcoes.h -funcoes.c -main.c -funcoes.o -main.o -makefile -main.exe

If you don't have one of this file you should look if you did not delete any file. In case you don't have the files .o just open your terminal and type "make".

If you have all files or you typed "make" in your terminal, just type "./main.exe" and our program will start!

In case you find some bugs please try to send me a email or a dm via twitter! I will try to be as fast as i can!

Enjoy!
Enjoy!
